# Java Projects in Processing IDE

This repository contains two projects developed in Java using the Processing IDE: **Tic-Tac-Toe** and **Solar System Animation**. Both projects leverage the unique features of Processing, a flexible software sketchbook and development environment tailored for visual arts and creative coding.

## About Processing

Processing is an open-source IDE designed for creating interactive graphics and animations. It provides an intuitive setup for coding and running sketches with minimal boilerplate. Unlike traditional Java IDEs, Processing includes its own core libraries for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, handling user input, and animating objects with ease. Key features include:

- **Graphics API**: Simplified methods like `ellipse()`, `rect()`, and `line()` for drawing shapes.
- **Built-in Animation Loop**: Automatic `draw()` method for real-time rendering.
- **Extensibility**: Additional libraries for sound, video, and hardware integration.

## Projects

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe
A graphical implementation of the classic two-player game. The project features:
- A visually dynamic game board created using Processing's 2D graphics.
- Interactive mouse inputs for marking X's and O's.
- Game logic for detecting wins, draws, and resetting the board.

### 2. Solar System Animation
A simulation of a simplified solar system with:
- Circular orbits and rotating planets around a central sun.
- Scalable graphics using Processing's 2D drawing functions.
- Smooth animations achieved through Processingâ€™s built-in frame loop.
