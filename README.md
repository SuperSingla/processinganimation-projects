# Java Projects in Processing

This repo has two fun projects made in Java using the **Processing IDE**: a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** and a **Solar System Animation**. Processing is a creative coding tool that makes it super easy to work with graphics and animations, and it's perfect for projects like these.

## What's Processing?


Processing is a simple and beginner-friendly environment for coding visual and interactive projects. It’s different from regular Java IDEs because:
- **Graphics API**: Simplified methods like `ellipse()`, `rect()`, and `line()` for drawing shapes.
- **Built-in Animation Loop**: Automatic `draw()` method for real-time rendering.
- **Extensibility**: Additional libraries for sound, video, and hardware integration.

## Projects

### Tic-Tac-Toe
A playable version of the classic game. Features include:
- A game board drawn with Processing's graphics functions.
- Clickable areas to place X's and O's.
- Logic to detect wins, ties, and restart the game.

### Solar System Animation
A simple animated solar system that shows:
- Planets orbiting a sun with smooth animations.
- Graphics and movement handled entirely with Processing’s built-in tools.
- A cool, minimalist take on celestial motion.
